# Solar Potential Comparison: Benin, Sierra Leone, and Togo

## Objective

This analysis synthesizes cleaned solar dataset metrics from Benin, Sierra Leone, and Togo to evaluate relative solar potential and identify key differences across these West African countries.

## Methodology

1. **Data Sources**: Cleaned datasets from the EDA phase for each country
2. **Key Metrics Analyzed**:
   - Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI)
   - Direct Normal Irradiance (DNI)
   - Diffuse Horizontal Irradiance (DHI)
3. **Analytical Approaches**:
   - Comparative boxplots
   - Summary statistics table
   - Statistical significance testing (ANOVA/Kruskal-Wallis)
   - Visual ranking

## Summary Statistics

| Country                            | GHI Mean | GHI Median | GHI StdDev | DNI Mean | DNI Median | DNI StdDev | DHI Mean | DHI Median | DHI StdDev |
| ---------------------------------- | -------- | ---------- | ---------- | -------- | ---------- | ---------- | -------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| [Country data will be filled here] |

## Statistical Testing

Results from one-way ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis tests (depending on data normality):

- **GHI**: [p-value and significance to be filled]
- **DNI**: [p-value and significance to be filled]
- **DHI**: [p-value and significance to be filled]

## Country Ranking by GHI

## Key Observations

- [Observation 1 about highest solar potential country]
- [Observation 2 about variability]
- [Observation 3 about radiation patterns]

## Implications for Solar Development

Based on this comparative analysis, we can draw the following conclusions for solar energy development:

1. **For Utility-Scale Solar Farms**: [Recommendations based on GHI]
2. **For Concentrated Solar Power**: [Recommendations based on DNI]
3. **For Distributed Photovoltaics**: [Recommendations based on diffuse radiation patterns]

## Limitations

- Analysis is limited to the timeframe of available data
- Local microclimate conditions may vary significantly within each country
- Other crucial factors for solar deployment (grid access, land availability, policy environment) are not included in this comparison
